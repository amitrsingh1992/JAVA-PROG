/*
Hashing Function to search a Number in a slot
a)Desc -> Create a Slot of 10 to store Chain of Numbers that 
          belong to each Slot to efficiently search a number 
          from a given set of number
b)I/P -> read a set of numbers from a file and take user input
         to search a number
c)Logic -> Firstly store the numbers in the Slot. 
           Since there are 10 Numbers divide each number by 11 
           and the reminder put in the appropriate slot. 
           Create a Chain for each Slot to avoid Collision. 
           If a number searched is found then pop it or else push it. 
           Use Map of Slot Numbers and Ordered LinkedList to solve the problem. 
           In the Figure Below, you can see number 77/11 reminder is 0 .
           Hence, sits in the 0 slot while 26/11 remainder is 4.
           Hence, sits in slot 4
d)O/P -> Save the numbers in a file

/*
24. Palindrome-Checker
    a. Desc -> A palindrome is a string that reads the same forward and backward, for
       example, radar, toot, and madam. We would like to construct an algorithm to
       input a string of characters and check whether it is a palindrome.
    b. I/P -> Take a String as an Input
    c. Logic -> The solution to this problem will use a deque to store the characters of
       the string. We will process the string from left to right and add each character to
       the rear of the deque.
    d. O/P -> True or False to Show if the String is Palindrome or not.

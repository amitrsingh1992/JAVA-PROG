25. Find the Fewest Notes to be returned for Vending Machine
    a. Desc -> There is 1, 2, 5, 10, 50, 100, 500 and 1000 Rs Notes which can be
               returned by Vending Machine. Write a Program to calculate the minimum number
               of Notes as well as the Notes to be returned by the Vending Machine as a
               Change
    b. I/P -> read the Change in Rs to be returned by the Vending Machine
    c. Logic -> Use Recursion and check for largest value of the Note to return change
                to get to minimum number of Notes.
    d. O/P -> Two Outputs - one the number of minimum Note needed to give the
              change and second list of Rs Notes that would given in the Change

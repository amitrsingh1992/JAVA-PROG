15. Question to find your number
    a. Desc -> takes a command-line argument N, asks you to think of a number
       between 0 and N-1, where N = 2^n, and always guesses the answer with n
       questions.
    b. I/P -> the Number N and then recursively ask true/false if the number is between
             a high and low value
    c. Logic -> Use Binary Search to find the number
    d. O/P -> Print the intermediary number and the final answer

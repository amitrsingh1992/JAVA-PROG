/*
 a)Desc -> 
 There is 1, 2, 5, 10, 50, 100, 500 and 1000 Rs Notes which can be returned by Vending Machine. 
 Write a Program to calculate the minimum number of Notes as well as the Notes to be returned by the Vending Machine as a Change
 b)I/P -> 
 read the Change in Rs to be returned by the Vending Machine
 c)Logic ->
 Use Recursion and check for largest value of the Note to return change to get to minimum number of Notes. 
 d)O/P -> Two Outputs - one the number of minimum Note needed to give the change and second list of Rs Notes that would given in the Change
